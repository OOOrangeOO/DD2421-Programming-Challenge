# DD2421-Programming-Challenge

This is The Great Programming Challenge HT23 for ccourse DD2421 (machine learning) at KTH

The inspiration is from [@morpheusthewhite ](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/ml-challenge-multiclass/tree/main)

In the `Modeling` folder, you can find the training data (`TrainOnMe.csv`) and data to be evaluated (`EvaluateOnMe.csv`). The detailed python code is in file `Programming Challenge.ipynb`.

In the `Challenge testing` folder, the groundtruth data is provided in `EvaluationGT.csv`, you can use `Final test.ipynb` to test your own prediction accuracy.

More information:

Welcome to the DD2421 ML Challenge.

In short, you must build and train a classifier given a labeled dataset and then use it to infer the labels of a given unlabeled evaluation dataset. You must then submit the inferred labels in a specified format, which will be compared to the ground truth. The accuracy of your model is proportional to the grade you receive. (Scaling will be done according to three parameters: a benchmark accuracy, a baseline accuracy, and a teacher's accuracy).
